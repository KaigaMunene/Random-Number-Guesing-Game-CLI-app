# Random-Number-Guessing-Game-CLI-app
## A project for guessing a random number.
CLI app that generates a random number from any range that is specified on user input.

The user must guess the random number and gets hints from the app. 

Every time a userâ€™s guess is wrong they get prompted with more hints to make it easier for them to guess the number but at the cost of reducing the score.

The hints include math operations like multiples, divisible, greater or smaller, or a combination of all.

The program also includes functions to check if an actual number is entered by the user or not, to generate a random number, to generate user input, to calculate the score.
