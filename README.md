# Random-Number-Guesing-Game-CLI-app
A project for guessing a random number.
Build a CLI app that generates a random number from
1 to 10, or 1 to 100 or any range
that is specified on user input. The user must guess
the number after a hint from your
app. Every time a userâ€™s guess is wrong they should
be prompted with more hints to
make it easier for them to guess the number but at
the cost of reducing the score.
The clues could include math operations like multiples, divisible, greater or smaller, or a
combination of all.
The program also requires functions to check if an
actual number is entered by the user
or not, to compare the input number with the actual
number, to find the difference
between the two numbers.
